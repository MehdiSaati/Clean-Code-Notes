# Clean Code Notes
Code is clean if it can be understood easily – by everyone on the team. Clean code can be read and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. With understandability comes readability, changeability, extensibility and maintainability.

<h1>Chapter 1 -  Clean Code</h1>
</a>
This Book is about good programming. It's about how to write good code, and how to transform bad code into good code.

The code represents the detail of the requirements and the details cannot be ignored or abstracted. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We can create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision.

### Why write bad code?

- Are you in a rush?
- Do you try to go "fast"?
- Do not you have time to do a good job?
- Are you tired of work in the same program/module?
- Does your Boss push you to finish soon?

The previous arguments could create a swamp of senseless code.

If you say "I will back to fix it later" you could fall in the [LeBlanc's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AList_of_eponymous_laws#Proposal_to_add_LeBlanc.27s_law) "Later equals never"

You are a professional and the code is your responsibility. Let's analyze the following anecdote:

> What if you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time? Clearly the patient is the boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to comply with the patient.

So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.

Maybe sometime you think in go fast to make the deadline. The only way to go fast is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

### What is Clean Code?

Each experimented programmer has his/her own definition of clean code, but something is clear, a clean code is a code that you can read easily. The clean code is code that has been taken care of.

In his book Uncle Bob says the next:

> Consider this book a description of the Object Mentor School of Clean Code. The techniques and teachings within are the way that we practice our art. We are willing to claim that if you follow these teachings, you will enjoy the benefits that we have enjoyed, and you will learn to write code that is clean and professional. But don’t make the mistake of thinking that we are somehow “right” in any absolute sense. There are other schools and other masters that have just as much claim to professionalism as we. It would behoove you to learn from them as well.

### The boy Scout Rule

It’s not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time. We have all seen code rot and degrade as time passes. So we must take an active role in preventing this degradation.

It's a good practice apply the [Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule)

> Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

<h1>Chapter 2 -  Meaningful Names</h1>
</a>

Names are everywhere in software. Files, directories, variables functions, etc. Because we do so much of it. We have better do it well.

### Use Intention-Revealing Names

It is easy to say that names reveal intent. Choosing good names takes time, but saves more than it takes. So take care with your names and change them when you find better ones.

The name of a variable, function or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how is used. **If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveals its intent**.

| Does not reveals intention       | Reveals intention       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `int d; // elapsed time in days` | `int elapsedTimeInDays` |

Choosing names that reveal intent can make much easier to understand and change code. Example:

```java
public List<int[]> getThem() {
  List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<int[]>();
  for (int[] x : theList)
    if (x[0] == 4)
      list1.add(x);
  return list1;
}
```

This code is simple, but create many questions:

1. What is the content of `theList`?
2. What is the significance of the item `x[0]` in the list?.
3. Why we compare `x[0]` vs `4`?
4. How would i use the returned list?

The answers to these questions are not present in the code sample, but they could have been. Say that we’re working in a mine sweeper game. We can refactor the previous code as follows:

```java
public List<int[]> getFlaggedCells() {
  List<int[]> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<int[]>();
  for (int[] cell : gameBoard)
    if (cell[STATUS_VALUE] == FLAGGED)
      flaggedCells.add(cell);
  return flaggedCells;
}
```

Now we know the next information:

1. `theList` represents the `gameBoard`
2. `x[0]` represents a cell in the board and `4` represents a flagged cell
3. The returned list represents the `flaggedCells`

Notice that the simplicity of the code has not changed. It still has exactly the same number of operators and constants, with exactly the same number of nesting levels. But the code has become much more explicit.

We can improve the code writing a simple class for cells instead of using an array of `ints`. It can include an **intention-revealing function** (called it `isFlagged`) to hide the magic numbers. It results in a new function of the function.

```java
public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
  List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();
  for (Cell cell : gameBoard)
    if (cell.isFlagged())
      flaggedCells.add(cell);
  return flaggedCells;
}
```

### Avoid Disinformation

Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We should avoid words whose entrenched meaning vary from our intended meaning.

Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`. The word `List` means something specific to programmers. If the container holding the accounts is not actually a List, it may lead to false conclusions. So `accountGroup` or `bunchOfAccounts` or just plain `accounts` would be better.

Beware of using names which vary in small ways. How long does it take to spot the subtle difference between a `XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings` in one module and, somewhere a little more distant, `XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings`? The words have frightfully similar shapes

### Make Meaningful Distinctions

Programmers create problems for themselves when they write code solely to satisfy a compiler or interpreter. For example because you can't use the same name to refer two different things in the same scope, you might be tempted to change one name in an arbitrary way. Sometimes this is done by misspelling one, leading to the surprising situation where correcting spelling errors leads to an inability to compile. Example, you create the variable `klass`because the name `class` was used for something else.

In the next function, the arguments are noninformative, `a1` and `a2` doesn't provide clues to the author intention.

```java
public static void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {
  for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
    a2[i] = a1[i];
  }
}
```

We can improve the code selecting more explicit argument names:

```java
public static void copyChars(char source[], char destination[]) {
  for (int i = 0; i < source.length; i++) {
    destination[i] = source[i];
  }
}
```

Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that you have a Product class. If you have another called `ProductInfo` or `ProductData`, you have made the names different without making them mean anything different. Info and Data are indistinct noise words like a, an, and the.

Noise words are redundant. The word variable should never appear in a variable name. The word table should never appear in a table name.

### Use Pronounceable Names

Imagine you have the variable `genymdhms` (Generation date, year, month, day, hour, minute and second) and imagine a conversation where you need talk about this variable calling it "gen why emm dee aich emm ess". You can consider convert a class like this:

```java
class DtaRcrd102 {
  private Date genymdhms;
  private Date modymdhms;
  private final String pszqint = "102";
  /* ... */
};
```

To

```java
class Customer {
  private Date generationTimestamp;
  private Date modificationTimestamp;;
  private final String recordId = "102";
  /* ... */
};
```

### Use Searchable Names

Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.

### Avoid Encoding

We have enough encodings to deal with without adding more to our burden. Encoding type or scope information into names simply adds an extra burden of deciphering. Encoded names are seldom pronounceable and are easy to mis-type. An example of this, is the use of the [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) or the use of member prefixes.

#### Interfaces and Implementations

These are sometimes a special case for encodings. For example, say you are building an ABSTRACT FACTORY for the creation of shapes. This factory will be an interface and will be implemented by a concrete class. What should you name them? `IShapeFactory` and `ShapeFactory`? Is preferable to leave interfaces unadorned.I don’t want my users knowing that I’m handing them an interface. I just want them to know that it’s a `ShapeFactory`. So if I must encode either the interface or the implementation, I choose the implementation. Calling it `ShapeFactoryImp`, or even the hideous `CShapeFactory`, is preferable to encoding the interface.

### Avoid Mental Mapping

Readers shouldn't have to mentally translate your names into other names they already know.

One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.

### Class Names

Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like `Customer`, `WikiPage`, `Account`, and `AddressParser`. Avoid words like `Manager`,`Processor`, `Data`, or `Info` in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

### Method Names

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like `postPayment`, `deletePage` or `save`. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with get, set, and is according to the javabean standard.

When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments. For example:

```java
Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
```

Is generally better than

```java
Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);
```

Consider enforcing their use by making the corresponding constructors private.

### Don't Be Cute

| Cute name         | Clean name    |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| `holyHandGranade` | `deleteItems` |
| `whack`           | `kill`        |
| `eatMyShorts`     | `abort`       |

### Pick one word per concept

Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes.

### Don’t Pun

Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.

Example: in a class use `add` for create a new value by adding or concatenating two existing values and in another class use `add` for put a simple parameter in a collection, it's a better options use a name like `insert` or `append` instead.

### Use Solution Domain Names

Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So go ahead and use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.

### Use Problem Domain Names

When there is no “programmer-eese” for what you’re doing, use the name from the problem domain. At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert what it means.

### Add Meaningful context

There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselves—most are not. Instead, you need to place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or namespaces. When all else fails, then prefixing the name may be necessary as a last resort

Variables like: `firstName`, `lastName`, `street`, `city`, `state`. Taken together it's pretty clear that they form an address, but, what if you saw the variable state being used alone in a method?, you could add context using prefixes like: `addrState` at least readers will understand that the variable is part of a large structure. Of course, a better solution is to create a class named `Address` then even the compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept

### Don’t Add Gratuitous Context

In an imaginary application called “Gas Station Deluxe,” it is a bad idea to prefix every class with GSD. Example: `GSDAccountAddress`

Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.
